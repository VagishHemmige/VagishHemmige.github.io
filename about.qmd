## Hi, I'm Vagish.

I work at the intersection of **infectious diseases** and **transplantation**, with a focus on **HIV care & prevention**, **HIV-to-HIV thoracic transplantation**, and building open, reproducible **R** workflows for large healthcare datasets.

I’m based in the **Bronx, New York**. Day to day, I split time between patient care, program building, and collaborative research—especially projects that improve access to transplant for people living with HIV and make complex data usable by clinical teams.

---

## What I’m working on

- **Transplant & HIV:** advancing pathways for HIV-positive donor thoracic transplants and sharing practical “how-to” resources for new programs.
- **Reproducible analytics in R:** I have extensive experience with using R to analyzes clinical data.
- **Education:** clinical reasoning, and bringing data skills to clinicians with approachable examples.

## Open-source projects

- **sRtr** — R helpers for working with UNOS/SRTR transplant data  
  <https://vagishhemmige.github.io/sRtr/>

- **strobe** — STROBE-style inclusion/exclusion tracking for observational studies  
  <https://vagishhemmige.github.io/strobe/>

- **usRds** *(in progress)* — utilities for loading, labeling, and converting USRDS claims files to Parquet with schema-aware helpers.

## Selected interests & methods

- **Clinical:** transplant ID, opportunistic infections, HIV prevention & primary care  
- **Research:** HIV and thoracic transplant, big data work with the SRTR and UNOS
- **Teaching:** I have taught clinical infectious diseases to trainees as well as statistics and epidemiology.

## Speaking & teaching

I enjoy guest lectures, workshops, and small-group sessions on:
- Practical R for clinicians and researchers
- Epidemiology and biostatistics
- Transplant ID topics (HIV D+/R+ programs, protocols, safety)

##Mentoring

I have mentored trainees in case reports, clinical research, and big data/research methods.

While I primarily mentor students, residents, and fellows at Montefiore Medical Center or Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
I do have projects for non-affiliates with R experience and skills that can be done remotely.
